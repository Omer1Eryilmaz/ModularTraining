# ModularTraining
Test repository for a modular training algorithm for deep neural networks.

Check the followings:
Klinear works in two conditions: direct evaluation (where \phi(x).T is the actual image of under the corresponding feature map) and indirect evaluation (where \phi(x).T =(k(c_1,x),...k(c_m,x)), k is the kernel function and c_i's are the centers.)

When are the feature maps implementable? When aren't?
Direct evaluation only works on kernels whose feature maps \phi's are implementable.
